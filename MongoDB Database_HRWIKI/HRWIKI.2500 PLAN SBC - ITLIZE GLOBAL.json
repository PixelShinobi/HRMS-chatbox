The SBC shows you how you and the plan would share the cost for covered health care services. NOTE: Information about the cost of this plan (called the premium) will be provided separately. This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, call 1-877-844-0280.or visit welcometouhc.com. For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount, balance billing, coinsurance, copayment, deductible, provider, or other underlined terms see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.healthcare.gov/sbc-glossary/ or call 1-866-487-2365 to request a copy. Important Questions Answers Why This Matters:\nWhat is the overall deductible?\nInternational: $0\nNetwork: $2,500 Individual / $5,000 Family\nOut-of-Network: $5,000 Individual / $10,000 Family\nPer calendar year.\nGenerally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all family members meets the overall family deductible. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible? Yes. Preventive care and categories with a copay are covered before you meet your deductible. This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive services at www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/. Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services. What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan? International: $2,000 Individual / $4,000 Family Network: $7,150 Individual / $14,300 Family Out-of-Network: $21,450 Individual / $42,900 Family Per calendar year. The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.\nWhat is not included in\nthe out-of-pocket limit?\nPremiums, balance-billing charges, health care this plan doesn’t cover and penalties for failure to obtain preauthorization for services.\nEven though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit. Will you pay less if you use a network provider? Yes. See myuhc.com or call 1-877-844-0280 for a list of network providers. This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan's network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider’s charge and what your plan pays (balance billing). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of-network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services.\nDo you need a referral to see a specialist? No. You can see the specialist you choose without a referral.\n* For more information about limitations and exceptions, see the plan or policy document at welcometouhc.com.
